					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<img src="images/intro_headIcon.jpg" alt "Au Chak Hon"> <br>
					<br>
					<p>Name: Au Chak Hon</p>
					<p>Codename: Armored Plague Doktor</p>
					<br>
					<p>He is a passionate comrade of Pinkfong who is willing to protect Pinkfong at all costs. If you hate Pinkfong, beware one day he will come for you.</p>
					<br>
					<p>For other people, Pinkfong may just be another cartoon character. Yet, for this comrade, Pinkfong is his commander, and he feels the responsibility to protect and fight for his glorious commander, even if this means death.</p>
					<br>
					<p>He is a lone warrior, having bad interpersonal relationships with others. He is not a good person in terms of communication and teamworking. He is also easily being irritated and may rage even for small problems and errors. Fortunately, if you were one of his friends, or if you are one of Pinkfong's comrades, he will be willing to share his joys and sorrows with you. Also, if you were one of his friends or if you are one of Pinkfong's comrades, he is willing to share everything with you and help you deal with problems... Given that you did not do something which makes him feel betrayed.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Overall, he is Pinkfong's one of the best comrades in terms of unfaltering will, and can be one of your best friends when you need support. However, if you hate Pinkfong, he will be your worst nightmare, as he will not hesitate on slicing Nazi bellies open before ripping out the organs.</p>
